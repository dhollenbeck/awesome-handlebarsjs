# handlebars-internals

The missing Handlbars.js internal documentation.

- [Passing Data](./docs/data.md)
- [Handlebars Compilers](./docs/compilers.md)
- [Resources](./docs/resources.md)

This documentation assumes that you have studied the [Handlebars Documentation](https://www.handlebarsjs.com) and want a much deeper dive.
